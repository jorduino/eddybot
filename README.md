# Eddybot

## About

This is a discord bot originally based off of my friend Eddy.

## Usage

Go to [https://discord.com/developers/applications](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and create an application, copy the token, and put it into a config.json file like the following:

```json
{
 "token":"token-from-discord-developers-page"
}
```

Then `npm install` and `npm start`

## Commands

All commands have been updated to the new slash commands that discord is now using with autocomplete. They can also be found in the `/commands` folder
